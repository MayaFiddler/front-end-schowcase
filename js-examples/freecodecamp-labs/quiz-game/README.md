# Random Quiz Logic (Vanilla JavaScript)

A small, framework-agnostic JavaScript module that demonstrates core programming concepts such as data structures, random selection, and logic separation.  
This project was created as a practice exercise and portfolio showcase.

- Random question selection
- Random answer selection
- Answer evaluation logic
- Clean, reusable, and extendable code

## 🧠 What This Project Demonstrates

This project focuses on **JavaScript fundamentals** rather than UI:

- Working with arrays and objects
- Writing reusable functions
- Using randomization (`Math.random`)
- Separating business logic from presentation
- Writing clean, readable, modern JavaScript

The logic is intentionally UI-agnostic so it can be reused in:
- A DOM-based quiz application
- A React or Vue component
- A backend quiz API
- Automated testing scenarios
