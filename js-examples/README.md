This folder contains small, focused JavaScript examples created to demonstrate
my understanding of core JavaScript concepts and practical frontend use cases.

The examples are intentionally kept simple and readable, with a focus on:
- clean logic
- real-world scenarios
- DOM interaction
- problem solving

Each subfolder groups examples by topic.
