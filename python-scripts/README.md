# Python Scripts

This folder contains Python practice files demonstrating **automation, data processing, and algorithmic problem-solving**.  

It is part of my **Frontend & Scripting Showcase**, highlighting my programming skills beyond frontend development.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **[automation/](./automation/)** – Small Python scripts demonstrating automation and basic data processing logic.  
  Example: [example-automation.py](./automation/example-automation.py)

- **[cs50-exercises/](./cs50-exercises/)** – Python exercises completed as part of the **CS50 Introduction to Computer Science** course.  
  Focuses on loops, conditionals, string manipulation, and algorithms.

## 💡 Notes

- These scripts demonstrate foundational Python skills, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.  
- They complement my frontend projects by showcasing versatility in both **web development** and **programming logic**.  
- More automation and Python exercises will be added over time to further showcase scripting skills.
