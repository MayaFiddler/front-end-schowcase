## 🐍 CS50 Python Exercises

| File | Description | Skills Demonstrated |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `mario.py` | Prints a console-based pyramid of a specified height | Loops, conditional logic, string manipulation |
| `cash.py` | Calculates the minimum number of coins needed to give change | Arithmetic operations, loops, greedy algorithms |
| `readability.py` | Estimates the readability level of a block of text | Text processing, string operations, functions |
| `caesar.py` | Implements the Caesar cipher for encrypting messages | Character encoding, loops, input validation |
| `vigenere.py` | Implements the Vigenère cipher for encrypting messages using a keyword | Modular arithmetic, loops, string indexing, cipher algorithms |

> Each script is well-documented with comments explaining the logic and thought process.

## 💡 Notes

- These scripts demonstrate foundational Python skills, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking.  
- They complement my frontend projects by showcasing versatility in both **web development** and **programming logic**.  
- More automation and Python exercises will be added over time to further showcase scripting skills.

## ⚡ Next Steps

- Expand the **automation** folder with small, practical Python scripts.  
- Continue solving algorithmic challenges to improve problem-solving skills.  
- Integrate Python knowledge into real-world projects when possible.
