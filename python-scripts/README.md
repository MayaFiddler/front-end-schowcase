# Python Scripts

This folder contains Python practice files focusing on **programming fundamentals, problem-solving, and basic automation**.

It is part of my **Frontend & Scripting Showcase**, highlighting my ability to work with Python alongside frontend development.

---

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **[automation/](./automation/)**  
  Small standalone Python scripts demonstrating basic automation and data-processing logic.  
  Example: [example-automation.py](./automation/example-automation.py)

- **[cs50-exercises/](./cs50-exercises/)**  
  Exercises completed as part of **CS50p – Introduction to Programming with Python** (Harvard University).  
  These files focus on Python fundamentals such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, file I/O, and basic object-oriented programming.

## 🐍 CS50 Python Exercises (CS50p)

The CS50p exercises are organized by topic and problem set, reflecting the structure of the course.

### Functions & Variables
- [hello.py](./cs50-exercises/hello.py) – User input and output
- [playback.py](./cs50-exercises/playback.py) – String formatting
- [indoor.py](./cs50-exercises/indoor.py) – String methods

### Conditionals
- [deep.py](./cs50-exercises/deep.py) – Conditional logic
- [home.py](./cs50-exercises/home.py) – Time-based decisions
- [extensions.py](./cs50-exercises/extensions.py) – File type detection

### Loops & Data Structures
- [camel.py](./cs50-exercises/camel.py) – String transformation
- [coke.py](./cs50-exercises/coke.py) – Loop-based user interaction
- [nutrition.py](./cs50-exercises/nutrition.py) – Dictionary lookups

### Exceptions
- [fuel.py](./cs50-exercises/fuel.py) – Input validation and error handling

### Libraries
- [emojize.py](./cs50-exercises/emojize.py) – Using external libraries
- [adieu.py](./cs50-exercises/adieu.py) – List handling and formatted output

### File I/O
- [lines.py](./cs50-exercises/lines.py) – File parsing and analysis
- [pizza.py](./cs50-exercises/pizza.py) – Reading and processing CSV files

### Regular Expressions
- [watch.py](./cs50-exercises/watch.py) – Pattern matching with regex

### Object-Oriented Programming
- [jar.py](./cs50-exercises/jar.py) – Classes, methods, and validation

> Each file includes a **docstring (`""" """`) at the top** describing its purpose and the concepts demonstrated.

## 💡 Notes

- These scripts demonstrate **core Python programming skills** rather than production-ready applications.
- Emphasis is placed on:
  - Clean logic
  - Readable code
  - Correct handling of user input
- The CS50p exercises complement my frontend work by showcasing backend-oriented thinking and scripting skills.

## ⚡ Next Steps

- Add more small automation scripts
- Apply Python logic to real-world data-processing tasks
- Continue combining frontend development with Python scripting where appropriate
