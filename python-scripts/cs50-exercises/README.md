## 💡 Notes

- Each file includes a **docstring (`""" """`) at the top** explaining the purpose of the script.
- The exercises focus on **core programming concepts** such as:
  - Loops and conditionals
  - String manipulation
  - Input validation
  - Algorithmic problem-solving
- These scripts are included as part of a broader **Frontend & Scripting Showcase** to demonstrate versatility beyond frontend development.
