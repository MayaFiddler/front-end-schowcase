# CS50 Python Problem Sets (CS50p)

This folder contains my solutions to exercises from **CS50p – Introduction to Programming with Python** (Harvard University).

The focus of these problem sets is on **Python fundamentals, clean logic, and problem-solving**, rather than building full applications.

## 💡 Notes

- All files include **docstrings (`""" """`)** explaining their purpose.
- Exercises demonstrate:
  - Variables and functions
  - Conditionals and loops
  - String manipulation
  - Exception handling
  - File input/output
  - Regular expressions
  - Basic object-oriented programming
- This folder is part of my **Frontend & Scripting Showcase** and complements my frontend projects with backend-oriented logic.
